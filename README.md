Location Based Q/A Platform:
This is  my final year project. The aim of this project is to help users to ask any sort of question to the other users in same city question. This android app uses Googleâ€™s Firebase Cloud FIrestore database as its backend. This app will help users in reaching to a local audience and get their views on any question. Users can ask and answer any question which helps in connecting people of same city.
